It is object oriented so it treats atoms, groups of atoms, trajectories, etc as different objects. Each object has a number of operations defined on itself (also known as “methods”) and also contains values describing the object (“attributes”). For example, a **AtomGroup** object has a **center_of_mass()** method that returns the center of mass of the group of atoms. It also contains an attribute called residues that lists all the residues that belong to the group. Using methods such as **select_atoms()** (which uses CHARMM-style atom Selection commands) one can create new objects (in this case, another **AtomGroup**)."

These components are ordered so that the first principal component accounts for the largest variance in the data, and each following component accounts for lower and lower variance. PCA is often applied to molecular dynamics trajectories to **extract the large-scale conformational motions or “essential dynamics” of a protein**. The frame-by-frame conformational fluctuation can be considered a linear combination of the essential dynamics yielded by the PCA.\n",
